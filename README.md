## 📖 The Story Behind Expirade

### The Problem We Discovered

In a world where independence is precious, imagine Sarah, a 45-year-old teacher who recently lost her vision due to diabetes complications. Every morning, she faces a challenge that most of us take for granted: checking if her medications are still safe to use. The tiny expiration dates printed on medicine bottles and packages become invisible barriers to her health and autonomy.

Sarah's story isn't unique. **Over 2.2 billion people worldwide** live with vision impairment, and millions more struggle with reading small text due to aging or visual difficulties. For them, expired medication isn't just inconvenient—it can be dangerous, potentially leading to reduced effectiveness or harmful side effects.

### Our Mission: Breaking Down Visual Barriers

This is where **Expirade** enters the story. Born from empathy and powered by cutting-edge technology, Expirade transforms any iPhone into an intelligent assistant that can "see" and "speak" expiration dates, giving users like Sarah their independence back.
